- 👋 Hi, I’m @r2ana
- 👀 I’m interested in tech usage, cooking, nature, and food
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about no code to understand how it may be used on the project I lead at the office
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any topic that we'll increase my tech knowledge
- 📫 How to reach me ? Let me think about that
